## Explanation
This layout was made specifically by me, for me. It's pretty left hand heavy, something like 55%-45%. I also use it with angle-mod and anyone who reverses the angle mod is cringed and unbased. It went through like 12 iterations during the making of the layout but basically I decided the `you` cluster in the top left was gonna be there no matter what and worked out what I wanted the homerow to be, then generated most of the rest with genkey before a few manual swaps. I also created the layout to specifically be lighter on the pinkies (but especially in terms of rolls involving the pinky) than semimak was because my hands hate doing that movement. I think the weirdest thing about this layout is the `h` on home row because it almost causes me to have a different home row resting place because `h` is such a common key. It creates a sort of cramped feel for the left hand which was a little weird but I think I'm used to it by now.
